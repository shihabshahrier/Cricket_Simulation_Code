# Cricket Simulation Code

This project is a simulation of a cricket game, implemented in Python. The `main.py` script is the entry point for the simulation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
The script will run the simulation and show the result in a graphical representation using Matplotlib. The simulation will show the scores and wickets of each team over the course of the game. The user can adjust the parameters of the simulation, such as the number of overs, number of teams, and team strengths, by modifying the relevant sections of the code.
